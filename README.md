# Hi, I'm Harry Cox 👋

### Backend Engineer | Efficiency Enthusiast | Leeds, UK

Straight-shooting backend dev based in Leeds. I like my code clean, my stout dry, and my front-end drama non-existent. I lean heavily on pragmatism and speed. If it ain’t broke, I'll probably still find a way to optimize it.
